  <p> 
This is an annual herb of the leguminous family. A recent addition to the Ethiopian pulse production, it is sweet in flavor. It grows in few areas of north Shoa. The plant is classed as an oil-seed rather than a pulse by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAQ).
<br><br>
Fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many pre-packaged meals; soy vegetable oil is another product of processing the soybean crop.
