  Limmu is one of the woredas in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia with Gelila as the administrative center of the woreda. It is a part of the Misraq ( East) Welega Zone bordering the exclave of Benishangul Gumuz Region in the south, Sasiga on the southwest, by Benishangul-Gumuz Region on the west, by Ibantu on the north and on the east by Gida Kiremu.<br/><br/>

Limmu coffee grows at an elevation of 1500-1900 MSL producing medium-sized beans with a characteristic round shape and a greenish colour. It is generally washed and it has a similar cupping profile to Sidama and Yirgacheffe coffee having a citric acidity, with soft berry undertones and chocolate-floral notes. The flavour is generally characterized by a balanced and clean cup.<br/><br/>

The Limmu coffee beans of Ethiopia have beautiful flavors of caramel and chocolate. Here the mouthfeel is also balanced, and this thing makes this coffee a distinct one. A fruity aroma blended with a grape-like taste sits on your mouth to offer a satisfying finish. A slightly more citric snap is one of the things that make Limmu coffee different from the next-door neighbors like Yirg and Sidamo.<br/><br/>

Coffee lovers also consider Limmu coffee more consistent and reliable compared to other variants of Ethiopian coffees, which sometimes be very fruity, acidic, and winey. The beans of this coffee have a distinctive round shape, a medium-size, and greenish color. But Ethiopian variety of Limmu G2 coffee has a winey acidity and a fuller body.
