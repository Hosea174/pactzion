  <br/>
  <p> 
This product, which is the smallest member of the bean group, draws attention with its unique flavor. Its homeland is Ethiopia, a bean variety. In our facilities, it becomes ready by going through the processes of sorting, stone separation, light grain sieving and color separation.

<span class="fw-bold">What are the benefits of beans?</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fw-semi-bold-200" style="text-decoration: underline">Fiber:</span> Most varieties of beans pack 5 to 9 grams of fiber per ½ cup! Just one or two servings of beans a day can give you a big boost toward daily fiber recommendations: 25 grams for women under 50, 31 grams for men under 50, 22 grams for women over 50, and 28 grams for men over 50.* Fiber helps you feel full after a meal and keeps your digestive system working efficiently. It can also help regulate blood sugar levels and promote heart health. If you’re wondering which bean has the most fiber, navy beans win with 9 ½ grams of fiber per ½ cup! (*Individual fiber needs are influenced by many conditions)
<br/><br/>
<span class="fw-semi-bold-200" style="text-decoration: underline">Protein:</span> Beans are an excellent source of plant-based protein. Half a cup of cooked beans has 7 to 9 grams of protein. Unlike animal-based proteins, beans do not contain saturated fat. When you eat beans, you get the benefits of protein without the heart-health risks associated with eating protein foods high in saturated fat. Different beans contain different amounts of essential amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, so it is important to eat a variety of beans to get a wide spectrum of nutrients.
<br/><br/>
<span class="fw-semi-bold-200" style="text-decoration: underline">Micronutrients:</span> In addition to fiber and protein, beans also include a whole host of vitamins and minerals. Beans are rich with zinc, iron, magnesium, and manganese. They also contain antioxidants that fight free radicals to prevent cell damage (oxidative stress). Antioxidant-rich foods help reduce risk for heart disease, stroke, cancer, and other diseases.
<br/><br/>
<span class="fw-bold">White beans are also:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Source of vitamin B9:</span> Cell renewal, very interesting for pregnant women for the development of the foetus, and for growing children, as well as for people recovering from illness.
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Source of potassium:</span> Nervous system, muscle function, blood pressure.
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Source of magnesium:</span> Fatigue reduction, energy, protein synthesis, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, bone and tooth health.
