  <p> 
We export organic Sunflower originated from Ethiopia. Sunflower Oil is one of those highly consumable agro products that have the biggest export rate. Sunflower oil is basically a triglyceride that contains Palmitic acid, Stearic acid, Oleic acid and Linoleic acid. If you keep this oil in room temperature, then it remains liquid.
<br><br>
If it is refined sunflower oil, then it looks clear and has the color of light amber. There is a fatty odor of this oil when you keep it at room temperature. It has high nutritional values. It contains saturated fat, energy, vitamin E, and K, etc. Chemical solvents can be used to extract this oil. There is another process known as expeller pressing where the sunflower seeds are crushed to get the oil.
