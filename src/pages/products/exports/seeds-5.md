  <p> 
Niger is a tiny, fine seed which is black in colour. It usually sprouts into a yellow flower, the scientific name being Guizotia abyssinica. Before being exported; the seed is treated and sterilized by intense heat to stop germination, and sprouting of any flowers in your garden and potentially harming other native plants.
<br><br>
Its fat is edible, and is also widely used for industrial purposes such as soap making, paints preparations and preparation of different types of emulsions.
