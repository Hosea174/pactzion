The Gedeo zone is located in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR) of Ethiopia and is known to produce some of the most well-balanced cups, with complexity in its flavors & acidity.<br><br>

Yirgacheffe is found right in the middle of the Gedeo Zone, with an altitude between 1,800 – 2,100 meters above sea level. This woreda boasts an abundance of lush-green vegetation, providing ideal growing conditions for coffee plantations, as coffee is grown in high-altitudes and in some methods, under the forest canopy. The Yirgacheffe region produces Ethiopia’s best & most complex profiles, with the majority of Yirgacheffe coffee being wet-processed. Although the naturally dried beans from this zone have been gaining some traction.<br><br>
