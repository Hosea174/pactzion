  <p> 
The Djimmah zone, named after the former Kingdom of Djimmah, is found in the region of Oromia. Djimmah is also the name of the main city here, and is the largest city in south-western Ethiopia. The majority of coffee from this zone is naturally processed – that is, laid out on raised beds above the ground and left to dry in the sun (i.e. sun dried). Djimmah coffee sold from the ECX is commercial grade and is used frequently in Arabica blends.<br><br>

It grows at an altitude of 1,500 to 2,000 m.a.s.l. the soil is red, and temperatures are conducive for coffee production. The area is known for distinct higher levels, and for that reason, it receives the highest rainfall in Ethiopia, conducive for coffee growing.<br><br>

Coffees from this region are reportedly best when washed. It has mild flavours of fruit and some sweet citrus. Bright citric acidity and a lovely silky body hold the coffee together. The finish is clean and satisfying.
